- stLookup CONTEXT =>
  CONTEXT 2 [k8s.io] DNS Federated
  CONTEXT 1 [k8s.io] DNS
- Case 1: I have "DNS Yo mama"
  - stop CONTEXT
  - start CONTEXT "DNS Yo mama"
- Case 2: I have "DNS Federated Blerg"
  - start CONTEXT "DNS Federated Blerg" (just like now)
- Case 3: I have "Foo"
  - stop CONTEXT
  - stop CONTEXT
  - start CONTEXT "Foo"

- this means that my parser needs context (heh) about the CONTEXT path it is in
- this should be easy to keep track of in our own global CONTEXT path stack
- if that path is not a prefix of our name, then this is not the start of a CONTEXT
- we'll fall through the linked ||s and end the enclosing context, poping from that path
- now the parent context will call us on the same line again, and perhaps now the path will match us
- but if not, pop again
- and eventually the global context path stack becomes empty and we are called from suite
